#!/bin/tcsh -f

# the line above must be there at the beginning of the script! It tells the system what shell to use to execute the script.
#the -f option tells tcsh not to process the .tcshrc file when it starts up. Generally, you don't want a script to do this, so -f is recommended. Don't use it with bash or sh scripts: it means something else and isn't needed
